# Dummy User
By default, a dummy user is set up every time when the application is launched. Login credential of the dummy user is as follows:
## Username: user0
## Password: testingtesttest

# Functions available
1. Create new users: New users created will be automatically saved in the database (we are using SQLite3 here). There is no need to recreate the SAME new user the next time you launch the application
2. Clear database: Connect to the virtual environment "env" and run "python database.py" to clear the database
